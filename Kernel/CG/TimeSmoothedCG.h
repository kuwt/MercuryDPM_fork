/*!
 * \brief Evaluates time-smoothed continuum fields and writes the data into a 
 * stat file.
 * \details
 * Like CG, this class should be used to evaluate time-dependent fields. 
 * However, as the data is averaged over several time steps, the resulting 
 * fields are smoother and more reliable, as they use more information.
 * For time-independent fields, see TimeAveragedCG.
 * 
 * The class is derived from CG, which already contains the basic 
 * functionality to obtain time-dependent statistics. This class then averages 
 * the field values F over time, with a non-uniform weight for each time step,
 * \f[\bar F(t,w_t) = \frac{\sum_i w(t-t_i) F(t_i)}{\sum_i w(t-t_i)},\f]
 * with the weight given by a Gaussian distribution,
 * \f[\bar w(t-t_i) = exp(-(t-t_i)^2/2w_t^2).\f]
