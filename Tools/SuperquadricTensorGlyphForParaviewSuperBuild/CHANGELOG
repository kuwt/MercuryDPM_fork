Version 3.0.1
=============

  * Fixed segfault if source contained only tensors with negative tensor
    eigenvalues
  * Fixed small memory leak
  * Added separate filter submenu
  * Removed own, bugfixed copy of vtkSuperquadricSource.cxx given that
    http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12179 got fixed
  * Updated to compile against ParaView trunk (option GUI_RESOURCE_FILES is deprecated)


Version 3.0
=============

  * Updated to compile with ParaView 3.98.0, and sped up combining
    separate quadrics step from order n squared time to order n time
    (Joseph Hennessey)


Version 2.0.2
=============

  * Fixed orientation inversion causing flipped surface normals
  * Fixed broken rendering of glyphs in multi-core mode
    (Both patches provided by Burlen Loring <bloring@lbl.gov>,
     see http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12179)
  * Don't apply Superquadric Glyph to points with negative tensor
    eigenvalues


Version 2.0.1
=============

  * Fixed compile errors with Visual Studio 2008 SP1


Version 2.0
============

  * Added ability to vary roundness settings per tensor.

    Version 1.0 of the filter lacked the ability to reproduce the
    novelty of the paper

       Gordon L. Kindlmann, Superquadric Tensor Glyph
       IEEE TVCG/EG Symposium on Visualization 2004

    i.e. to have different roundness settings per tensor, based on its
    eigenvalues.

    A checkbox now optionally enables roundness-per-tensor. Setting it
    automatically disables the widgets to enter Theta and Phi
    Roundness manually.

  * If ColorGlyphs checkbox is checked and ColorMode is set to
    eigenvalues, eigenvalues are provided as an additional data
    array. This information can subsequently be used for thresholding
    or coloring.

  * Provide an option to limit the scaling by eigenvalues. This helps
    when dealing with data that features tensors with very large
    eigenvalues.

  * The VTK implementation of superquadric yields a wrong orientation. It
    claims to offer z as axis of symmetry, but does not. Additionally,
    it is not possible to set the axis to anything else which is
    necessary for a correct implementation of the Kindlmann paper.

    See http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=11231

    Use my own, corrected implementation for SuperquadricTensorGlyphs
    from now on.

  * Provide the mentioned correct implementation of a superquadric as
    a new source


Version 1.0
============

  * Initial version. Use a superquadric tensor glyph to visualize
    tensors by scaling each glyph according to a tensor's eigenvalues
    or the norms of an individual tensor's columns. Positive-definite
    tensors are assumed, i.e. tensors that have only real, positive
    eigenvalues.
