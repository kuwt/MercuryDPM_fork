#Â JMFT: This line needs to come at the bottom, after Parts 1 and 2.
# This is the other way round to the CMakeLists.txt file in other directories,
# where it has to come at the top;
# see e.g. ../Tutorials/CMakeLists.txt.
# This is because the tests in this directory will produce executables whose
# names end in 'demo', which need to be run _before_ outputs from them are
# compared.
# TODO: This naming should be changed to avoid this kludge.
