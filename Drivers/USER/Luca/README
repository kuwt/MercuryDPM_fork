- Helicoid: the screw is implemented with angles. The edges are rounded, and the rotation works but due to mistakes in the fmod() of the angular difference it
	doesn't work after a while it started spinning.	*** OBSOLETE. DO NOT USE. ***
- Helicoid02: implementation is by means of the axial distance. The file is polished of unnecessary stuff and there are no computations of angles, just sqrt()s.
	The edges are rounded.
- Helicoid03: the same stuff of Helicoid02, but with sharp edges.
- Helicoid04: triangular wall. NOTE: the variable "shaft radius" is needed in the function call.
- Helicoid05: the collision with the shaft is added to Helicoid03. NOTE: the variable "shaft radius" is needed in the function call.
	17.04.17: tested Helicoid 03 vs. Helicoid05. No difference in the particles' physics. --> *** FROM NOW ON USE HELICOID05 AS STANDARD ***
- Helicoid06: left-handed screw implemented starting from Helicoid03. NOTE: the variable "shaft radius" is needed in the function call. *** STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT. SHOULD NOT BE USED. ***
- Helicoid07: evolution of Helicoid05 with modulated shaft size. *** STOPPED THE IMPLEMENTATION. FINITE SCREW NEEDED. ***
