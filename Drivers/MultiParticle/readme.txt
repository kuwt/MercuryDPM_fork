Here you will find the set of examples that demonstrate use cases for multiparticle system of MercuryDPM

Each driver file can be run in tow modes

1) "make driver_file",	"./driver file" - manual way of running the examples
2) "./auto_driver_file" - this executable will erase previous output, re-compile driver file, use data2pvd to create complete paraview output (this way hides all the output).

Multiparticles (clumps) are generated using MClump tool, located in the MercuryDPM source folder at ./tools/MClump
